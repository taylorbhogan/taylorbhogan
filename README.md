### Hi there! I'm Taylor.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Typescript...
- 👨‍💻 And caring for the Yosemite National Park Community website.
- 🏔 Just re-joined a climbing gym for the first time since the pandemic hit...
- ⚽️ And a soccer league for the first time since I let that ball go between my legs when I was 9. Wish me luck.
- 😎 Check out my portfolio at [taylorbhogan.me](taylorbhogan.me)

Fun facts:
- 🌏 I've lived on 3 continents, if you count the middle of the Pacific as a continent.
- 👨‍🎓 My university gave me a full academic scholarship...and I still joined a bootcamp afterwards. Education is changing.
- 🦅 This is still somehow the best emoji I can find to accompany the fact that I'm an Eagle Scout.
